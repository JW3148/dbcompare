# dbcompare

The goal of dbcompare is to compare tables accross sql server instances.
    It provides tools to identify table dependencies for a given stored procedure;
    evaluate data discrepancies between source server and target server; It also provide a
    solution to manage reference data or lookup data across servers

## Installation

You can install dbcompare from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JW3148/dbcompare")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to compare tables used by a stored procedure on two servers:

```{r example,eval = FALSE}
## basic example code
udf_CompareSourceTarget(source_server, target_server, db, proc)
```
